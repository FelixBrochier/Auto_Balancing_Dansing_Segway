# Auto_Balancing_Dansing_Segway

This project, called the self-balancing dancing segway, can be divided in 2 parts:
The dancing segway and the self-balancing segway. Both are coded in VS Code.
The dancing segway project's aim was to teach us how to use MicroPython, callibrate the 2 motors, and tune the microphone to react to sound and music.
The self-balancing segway on the other hand was an introduction to PID controllers, how to tune it and create a feedback-control system between the motors and the gyroscope.

Skills gained through this project:

MicroPython

PID tuning

Motor callibration
